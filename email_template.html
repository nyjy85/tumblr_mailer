  	Yo biaattch update me with some gossip.  By the way, I coded this e-mail so that it specifically outputs that last line when I mention your name.  So other people get a formal, boring stiff email intro but you get the personalized one.  Hehehehe~ Smoke weeed every day.  Ok, now onto the boring email template.
  <% } else { %>
    How are you doing? I'm doing well. 
    <%  } %>
    It's been almost <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months
    since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and enjoying 
    my time. This is an auto-generated email I learned how to make in Fullstack Foundations so sorry if it sounds a little stiff.
